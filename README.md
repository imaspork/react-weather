# AQI Checker
# Published on https://airqualitychecker.surge.sh/

This is my first iteration production build of my air quality checker. This page utilizes an API and fetches local data based on user input.

This application was made with React.JS and styled with Chakra UI with some simple axios fetching and error handling. This was my first time using the component library!
